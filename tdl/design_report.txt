Tea Break To-Do Lounge Redesign - Change Log
--------------------------------------------
Date: 2025-10-21

1. UI Transformation
   - Rebuilt the main layout with a lounge-inspired shell, orange and white stripes, and a two-column composition for ambience (src/App.jsx, src/App.css).
   - Added a decorative shelf vignette with kettle, steam, and chair accents to reinforce the requested theme (src/App.jsx, src/App.css).

2. New Placeholder Utilities
   - Introduced guided placeholders for an image drop, focus timer, and calendar planning space (src/App.jsx, src/App.css).
   - Expanded the creation form with headline, calendar, timer, and notes placeholders to preview future features (src/components/Form.jsx, src/components/CSS/form.css).

3. Task Interaction Enhancements
   - Applied GSAP powered animations so task cards animate into place after state changes (src/App.jsx).
   - Restyled tasks with shelf inspired cards, a custom toggle, and empty state copy (src/components/List.jsx, src/components/Cart.jsx, src/components/CSS/List.css).
   - Corrected checkbox handling and delete affordance for better accessibility (src/components/Cart.jsx).

4. Data Flow Improvements
   - Stopped the previous fetch loop and now refresh tasks after create, update, and delete, while blocking blank submissions (src/App.jsx, src/components/Form.jsx).

5. Tooling
   - Added the GSAP dependency for animation support (package.json).
